# Two Platforms. One Compliance Stack.
## How amleht and Duna Complete the European Financial Compliance Picture

---

## Europe's Compliance Moment

DORA enforcement began January 2025. Every European financial institution must now prove operational resilience across their entire digital infrastructure. At the same time, AML directives are tightening, PSD3 is reshaping payments, and the EU AI Act is adding new layers of scrutiny. European banks face a compliance mountain with two faces: who is this business, and is their infrastructure sovereign and resilient? Today, no single platform answers both questions.

---

## The Two Questions Every Bank Must Answer

Question one: Is this business who they say they are? Identity verification, KYB onboarding, anti-money laundering screening. This is the front door of compliance — and this is what Duna does brilliantly with AI-native identity verification.

Question two: Is their infrastructure sovereign and DORA compliant? Data residency, operational resilience, ICT risk management, third-party vendor oversight. This is the engine room of compliance — and this is what amleht was built to solve with 10 specialised AI agents running on EU-sovereign infrastructure.

Zero overlap. Complete complementarity.

---

## Introducing amleht | EU

EU Sovereign Multi-Agent Infrastructure Intelligence. Built in Amsterdam, hosted on European servers, inference running on Nebius Token Factory in Helsinki. No US CLOUD Act exposure. Data never leaves EU/EEA jurisdiction.

amleht provides European financial institutions with an AI-powered platform that assesses, monitors, and reports on infrastructure sovereignty and operational resilience. Ten specialised agents cover every dimension of the compliance landscape — from DORA and MiFID II to carbon reporting and mainframe modernisation.

The platform is live at amleht.eu.

---

## The 10-Agent Architecture

The platform runs 10 specialised AI agents, each an expert in its domain, orchestrated by a Concierge agent that routes queries to the right specialist.

Agent 01 — Concierge: Intelligent routing and orchestration across all agents.
Agent 02 — AWS Infrastructure: Cloud-native assessment, sovereignty analysis, cost optimisation.
Agent 03 — GCP Infrastructure: Google Cloud posture, BigQuery, Anthos analysis.
Agent 04 — Equinix & Colocation: Bare metal, interconnection, data centre sovereignty.
Agent 05 — Network Diagnostics: eBPF probes, digital twins, enterprise network troubleshooting.
Agent 06 — Carbon & CSRD: Scope 1-3 emissions, PUE analysis, sustainability reporting.
Agent 07 — IBM Z Mainframe & Hybrid: z/OS modernisation, LinuxONE, hybrid cloud paths.
Agent 08 — Legal & Regulatory: DORA, GDPR, MiFID II, AML, MAR compliance mapping.
Agent 09 — SAP RISE Sovereign Migration: BTP runtime parity, 2027 deadline readiness.
Agent 10 — Project Management & PMO: Delivery governance, tracking, executive reporting.

Every agent maps its analysis to specific regulatory articles. Every recommendation is traceable to a compliance requirement.

## EU-Sovereign by Design

Sovereignty is not a feature we added — it is the foundation everything is built on.

Inference runs on Nebius Token Factory in Helsinki, Finland. European-owned, European-operated, no US jurisdiction exposure. The platform is hosted on statichost.eu, a GDPR-compliant Swedish hosting provider running on Hetzner European servers. Source code managed on GitHub with automated deployment via EU infrastructure.

The aurora borealis in our brand represents this: Finland blue for Nebius inference, Ireland green, Netherlands orange for our Amsterdam home, France red, EU blue and gold for the sovereignty that binds it all together. Every colour is a member state. Every colour tells a sovereignty story.

## Introducing Duna

Duna is an AI-native business identity platform built for European financial institutions. Founded by Duco van Lanschot (former Stripe, Fourthline) and David Schreiber (former Trade Republic, Stripe), Duna raised a €30M Series A led by CapitalG with backing from Frank Slootman (Snowflake), Pieter van der Does (Adyen), and Guillaume Princen (Anthropic).

Duna verifies business identity with AI-powered KYB onboarding, covering AMLD5/6, PSD2/3, DAC7, and KYC regulations. Their vision: a global trust infrastructure providing a digital passport for every business.

Duna is Amsterdam-based. amleht is Amsterdam-based. Both are building for European financial institutions. Both are AI-native. Both are solving compliance — from opposite ends.

---

## Complementary Platforms — Zero Overlap

Duna covers: AMLD5/6, PSD2/3, DAC7, KYC/KYB — business identity and onboarding compliance.

amleht covers: DORA, MiFID II, GDPR (infrastructure), MAR, CSRD — infrastructure sovereignty and operational resilience.

Duna asks: "Is this business who they say they are?"
amleht asks: "Is their infrastructure sovereign and DORA compliant?"

Duna's AI verifies identity documents and business registrations.
amleht's AI assesses cloud posture, mainframe readiness, and regulatory compliance across 10 specialised domains.

There is zero regulatory overlap between the two platforms. This is the cleanest partnership story in European fintech compliance.

---

## Three Partnership Models

Model 1 — Referral Pipeline: Duna's KYB clients need infrastructure compliance assessment. amleht's clients need identity verification for their own onboarding. Shared pipeline, mutual referrals, no competition.

Model 2 — Trust Bundle: Duna's digital passport verifies business identity. amleht's sovereignty assessment verifies infrastructure compliance. Combined, they create a trust score no single competitor can offer: "This business is KYB-verified AND their infrastructure is DORA-compliant." A verified trust bundle for European financial services.

Model 3 — Co-Sell to Banks: Joint proposals to European banks as a combined compliance stack. One conversation, two platforms, complete coverage from identity to infrastructure. A uniquely European alternative to fragmented US-dependent solutions.

---

## Why the Netherlands First

The four largest Dutch banks employ 14,000 compliance staff. Seven thousand of them work exclusively on business compliance. The infrastructure side employs a comparable number managing operational resilience, vendor oversight, and regulatory reporting.

Duna and amleht are both Amsterdam-based, both building for this exact market. The Dutch financial ecosystem — ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank, de Volksbank, plus dozens of fintechs and asset managers — is the natural starting patch for a combined European offering.

Duco himself said it: banks spend 10-20% of total costs on compliance and identity using expensive, manual legacy systems. amleht addresses the infrastructure half of that same mountain with AI automation.

---

## The Market Opportunity

Gartner forecasts European sovereign cloud spending will triple to €20.7 billion by 2027. DORA affects over 22,000 financial entities across the EU. The EU Cloud and AI Development Act (CADA) will add eligibility restrictions on non-EU providers. European banks are actively seeking European solutions — the political and regulatory tide is running in one direction.

Duna and amleht, working together, can capture both sides of this wave: the identity and onboarding compliance that comes first, and the infrastructure sovereignty compliance that follows.

---

## Validated and Proven

amleht's platform has been through comprehensive validation:

10 specialised AI agents covering DORA, MiFID II, GDPR, AML, Carbon/CSRD, SAP RISE, IBM Z, and more. 56 reproducible test evidence files across full platform validation — run twice for consistency proof. 100% EU-sovereign inference via Nebius Token Factory running from Helsinki, Finland. 20 years of enterprise infrastructure experience — UBS, Deutsche Bank, AWS — backing every architectural decision.

The platform is not a concept. It is built, tested, and live at amleht.eu.
