# Synthesia Video Scripts — amleht x Duna Partnership

## Setup Instructions

### Background
Upload `amleht-aurora-backdrop.mp4` as a custom video background in Synthesia.
The aurora loops seamlessly at 15 seconds — Synthesia will auto-loop it for the full video duration.

### Avatar
Choose a professional male or female avatar. Position them slightly left or right of centre
to let the aurora colours breathe on the other side.

### Logo Overlay (optional)
If Synthesia supports image overlays, place `amleht-logo-compact-white.png` in the
bottom-right corner at small size (roughly 15% of frame width). The white logo works
against the dark aurora backdrop.

## VIDEO 1: LinkedIn Teaser (35-40 seconds)

### Purpose
Hook for LinkedIn / social media. Piques curiosity, drives to amleht.eu or the full video.

### Script

European banks face two compliance questions they can't answer with one platform.

Question one — is this business who they say they are?
Question two — is their infrastructure sovereign and DORA compliant?

Duna answers the first. amleht answers the second. Zero regulatory overlap. Complete complementarity.

Ten specialised AI agents. EU-sovereign inference from Helsinki. Built in Amsterdam for European financial institutions.

Two platforms. One compliance stack.

See the full story at amleht.eu.

### Synthesia Settings
- Duration: ~35 seconds
- Pace: Confident, measured
- Pauses: Brief pause after each question, longer pause before "Two platforms"

## VIDEO 2: Full Presentation for Duco (75-90 seconds)

### Purpose
Companion to the Gamma deck. Duco watches this before or after browsing the slides.
Sets the tone for the 45-minute walkthrough conversation.

### Script

Every European financial institution now faces two compliance challenges that no single platform can solve.

The first challenge is identity. Is this business who they say they are? Are they legitimate? Are they compliant to onboard? This is what Duna does — AI-native business identity verification covering anti-money laundering directives, payment services, and KYC regulations.

The second challenge is infrastructure. Is their technology sovereign? Is it operationally resilient under DORA? Can they prove it to their regulator? This is what amleht was built to solve.

amleht runs ten specialised AI agents — covering everything from cloud infrastructure and mainframe modernisation to carbon reporting and regulatory compliance mapping. Every agent traces its analysis to specific regulatory articles. Every recommendation is auditable.

Our inference runs on Nebius Token Factory in Helsinki. European-owned, European-operated. No US CLOUD Act exposure. Data never leaves EU jurisdiction.

Here's what makes this partnership compelling. Duna and amleht have zero regulatory overlap. Duna covers identity — AMLD, PSD, KYC. amleht covers infrastructure — DORA, MiFID, GDPR. Two Amsterdam-based platforms, serving the same customers, from opposite ends of the compliance stack.

Together, we can offer European banks something no one else can — a verified trust bundle combining business identity and infrastructure sovereignty in a single conversation.

The platform is live at amleht.eu. I'd welcome a forty-five minute walkthrough to explore where our platforms intersect.

Two platforms. One compliance stack. Built in Amsterdam, for Europe.

### Synthesia Settings
- Duration: ~80 seconds
- Pace: Professional, warm, unhurried
- Pauses: Brief pause between sections, slightly longer before "Here's what makes this partnership compelling"
- Emphasis: "zero regulatory overlap", "Two platforms. One compliance stack."
